### Create a java socket  program which has the following functionality:

**Server:** The server contains multiple (at least 3) text files. The client can send a request with a text filename to the server. If the file exists, the server should send the contents of the file to the client. Otherwise the server should return file not found message.

**Client:** The client requests the server to send the data stored in a text file by sending the filename. When the server sends the file data back to the client, the client should print the data in the console.

Note that, this task does not require GUI.
