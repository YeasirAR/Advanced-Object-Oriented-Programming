## QUESTION1
Suppose you have a class University as follows: 

```java
class University{
    String name;
    int studentsCount;
    int facultyCount;
}
```

1. Add a parameterized constructor to the **University** class (to initialize all the instance variables).
2. Create an ArrayList of at-least 5 objects of University . The data of the **University objects** should either be input by the user **or** should be read from a file.
3. Sort the University ArrayList according to the **studentsCount** of the University in **descending** order.
4. Write the University ArrayList object to a file using **ObjectOutputStream**


## Question2
Create a generic function sum that takes two integer/double numbers as parameters and prints the sum.

Example: 
```java
sum(1.5, 3.5);     // prints: 5
sum(100, 200);     // prints: 300
```
